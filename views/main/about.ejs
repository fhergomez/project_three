                <h5>Git & Heroku Master/Web Developer</h5>
                <p>I'm a web-developer in Seattle, WA. I get to spend my time learning new things, mastering a craft, and using analytical thinking skills to solve interesting problems. Before my career in web-development, I was an officer in the Army, where I honed my ability to manage projects, collaborate with others, and get up really early in the morning.</p>

                <p>I feel fortunate to work in an industry where passion and community are at the heart of our values. It inspires me to meet so many people who are wholly unique yet still share a common ground. There's not too many industries where a passion for fun and the great outdoors seeps from every corner.</p>
